# Imaging Analysis Scripts for Quantitative Zebrafish Data
% Developed by Dr. Jessica C. M. Hui during her research at
% The Chinese University of Hong Kong and The University of Hong Kong.
% Sample data used with this script was collected at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

This repository contains a suite of original image and video analysis scripts developed by **Dr. Jessica C. M. Hui** during her doctoral and postdoctoral fellowship in biomedical research. These MATLAB-based tools support motion tracking, peristaltic wave quantification, and other physiological imaging analyses in zebrafish and similar live animal models.

## Description

These tools were independently conceptualised and implemented to address challenges in high-throughput, imaging-based analysis of live model organisms. Features include:

- Time-series motion extraction  
- Contraction frequency and amplitude detection  
- Region-based intensity analysis  
- Integration with imaging pipelines (FIJI/ImageJ, MATLAB, Python)

All scripts were written during Dr. Hui’s research appointments at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong** and **The University of Hong Kong**.  
All sample data and videos included in or referenced by this repository were collected during her time at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong**.
