# Imaging Analysis Scripts for Quantitative Zebrafish Data

This repository contains a suite of original image and video analysis scripts developed by **Dr. Jessica C. M. Hui** during her postdoctoral fellowship in biomedical research. The scripts were written to support motion tracking, peristaltic wave quantification, and other physiological imaging metrics in zebrafish and similar models.

## Description

These tools were independently conceptualised and implemented to address challenges in high-throughput, imaging-based analysis of live animal models. Functions include:

- Time-series motion extraction
- Contraction frequency and amplitude detection
- Region-based intensity analysis
- Integration with imaging pipelines (FIJI/ImageJ, MATLAB, Python)
